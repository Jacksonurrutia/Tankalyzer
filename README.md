# Tankalyzer

## Executive Summary
What would you do if just your mere presense caused all the fish inside you're fishtank to die spontaniously?  What would you do if just like me you have multiple fish tanks and no matter how much you would like to, you can not sit staring at them all day?  Would you like to know what's going on inside your fishtank at all times?  Well the Tankalyzer is the revolution you have been waiting for!   The Tankalyzer uses sensors to monitor all the equipment on a fish tank and even the fish themselves.

## Project Goals
- Use a MetaWear sensor to detect if the equipment on a fish tank is running.
- Use a MetaWear sensor to detect if the fish inside a fish tank are moving.
- Have an app that allows a user to see the status of a fish tank.

## User Stories
### As a user I want to see if the equipment on my fish tank is still running, so if it isn't I can fix it.
#### Acceptance Criteria
- Have an indication that the equipment is still running.
- Have an alert when equipment stops running

### As a user I want to know if the fish in my fish tank are alive so I can replace non-alive fish.
#### Acceptance Criteria
