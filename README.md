# Tankalyzer

## Executive Summary
What would you do if just your mere presense caused all the fish inside you're fishtank to die spontaniously?  What would you do if just like me you have multiple fish tanks and no matter how much you would like to, you can not sit staring at them all day?  Would you like to know what's going on inside your fishtank at all times?  Well the Tankalyzer is the revolution you have been waiting for!   The Tankalyzer uses sensors to monitor all the equipment on a fish tank and even the fish themselves*.
